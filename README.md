<h1>Predicting Stock Volatility from Financial Reports with Regression</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This paper addresses a text regression problem, where the objective is to predict a real-world continuous quantity based on a given piece of text. Specifically, we focus on SEC-mandated financial reports as the text input and aim to forecast the quarterly volatility of stock returnsâ€”an empirical metric of financial risk. Our approach involves assessing the performance of various models in predicting volatility, with mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) serving as the evaluation. Furthermore, we investigate the identification of the most crucial natural language processing (NLP) features within the best-performing model, adding depth to our understanding of the connection between textual information and quantitative predictions in the financial domain.
